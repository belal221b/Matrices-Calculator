# **Matrices Calculator**
This project is a C++ program that allows you to perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses two classes, Matrix and Complex, to represent matrices and complex numbers respectively.

# **Matrix Class**
The Matrix class is used to represent matrices. It contains the following public members:

- arr - a two-dimensional vector that holds the elements of the matrix.
- rows - an integer that represents the number of rows in the matrix.
- column - an integer that represents the number of columns in the matrix.


# **Complex Class**
The Complex class is used to represent complex numbers. It contains the following public members:

- real - a float that represents the real part of the complex number.
- img - a float that represents the imaginary part of the complex number.
- subR - a string that represents the real part of the complex number in string form.
- subI - a string that represents the imaginary part of the complex number in string form.
- 
The Complex class also contains methods for setting and getting the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, converting the real and imaginary parts from string to float, and initializing the complex number.

# **Usage**
To use the program, you can create a new Matrix object and call its methods to perform matrix operations. You can also create a new Complex object and call its methods to perform operations on complex numbers.

The convert_to_REAL_vector function can be used to convert a string input into a two-dimensional vector of floats. This function is used to convert user input into matrices.
